Indian Legal Documents Summarization

The repository contains the dataset and result of the paper "Indian Legal Text Summarization: A Text Normalisation-based Approach"

Our contributions can be summarized as below:

* We introduced a new methodology for Indian Legal text-preprocessing.
* We create a dataset with Indian Legal abbreviation & its full version.
* We experiment with two state-of-the-art text summarization model (BART and PEGASUS) without fine-tuning them to evaluate our proposed methodology.
